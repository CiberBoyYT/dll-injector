# DLL Injector
This is an open-source DLL Injector I coded. 
It is capable of injecting a DLL into a running process that the user specifies by modifying the process in memory to inject the DLL.
As usual, it needs administrator rights.
# Compatibility
This DLL Injector is compatible with Windows XP and forward, but I have only tested on Windows 10.
If you experience any bugs, issues or incompatibilities, please create an issue :)
# For skids
Alright, I know some people will skid my code.
I added a GNU Public license 3, which means that you can use my code freely in your program 
but ONLY if you credit me, and you must make your program open source as well.
If you don't credit me and make your program open source, you're inflinging this software terms and you accept the responsability.
# Disclaimer
This program was coded entirely for educational purposes and running it on isolated environments.
Therefore, the creator (CiberBoy) doesn't make responsible for any malicious uses of this code to inject DLLs with malicious behavior
into legit programs or for any other malicious intent. This code itself isn't malicious, whoever uses it wrongly makes it malicious.
